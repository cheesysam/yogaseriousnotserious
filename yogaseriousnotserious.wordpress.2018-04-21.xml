		<title>Svadhyaya, Santosha, and Instagram</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'd like to talk about Instagram, and where it fits with my yoga practice. Of course, Instagram certainly isn't a traditional method of yoga practice, but we work with what we've got. Particularly I'd like to talk about whether there are benefits in Instagram, when held agains some of the traditional yoga teachings, in this case Svadhyaya and Santosha.
<h2>Instagram</h2>
I joined Instagram as a direct result of hearing about its vibrant yoga scene. Not long after becoming recognisable as a regular to the yoga class, someone had told me to get involved. The scene is indeed vibrant. It seems almost every other Instagram member is showing off their poses. Stop drop and yoga and all that.
It didn't take long to find some guys doing exactly what it was I wanted to be doing with my asana practice. Finding these role models to aspire to got me working harder and contributing more and more to Instagram. My yoga practice was developing. I can't solely attribute this progress to Instagram, but getting a photo up most days meant I really had to be practicing most days. Every now and then one of the role models I followed intently would throw a comment my way after I shamelessly followed their practice and their style.

There's a class of Instagram accounts which can only be described as the yoga celebrities. There's no need to name names, no doubt you can list a few without much prompting. But there is a subset of these celebrities who I believe go further, who fit in as more of a role mode. I am all for role models. Throughout life there's never been a time where I haven't been trying to do the same as someone else. For years I've considered this to be something of a flaw in my own character. Am I really going to be a strong individual, given that never has there been a time when I haven't been admiring someone else and trying to emulate what I see in them? Through some inward looking I've decided this is only a desire to grow into the individual I hope to be.

The difference I see between celebrities and role models is their intent. A role model might go out of their way to cater to those looking for inspiration. The average celebrity seems to look more inwardly.

Then, how does posting on Instagram and the pursuit of Instagram celebrities as role models fit with the yoga teachings? Two of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niyama" target="_blank">niyamas</a> from the eight limbs of yoga, Santosha and Svadhyaya, I believe still have a place alongside the yoga of Instagram.
<h2>Santosha</h2>
Santosha is the yogic practice of self contentment and satisfaction. Through self contentment comes happiness. If we only look at perfection, it's not easy to relinquish making comparisons between others and ourselves. There's powerful emotion in these comparisons, and I doubt the anxiety which accompanies such emotion is alien to anybody.
The yoga celebrities of Instagram should be aware of the status and the accompanying image they project, however it's worth remembering that the detachment from this emotion can only be found within myself. Keeping my practice personal and non-competitive is the answer.
<h2>Svadhyaya</h2>
Svadhyaya is a Sanskrit term in Hinduism which literally means "one's own reading". The intent of Svadhyaya is to study the way in which we are developing, to make time to readdress our goals and reassess our path.
Yoga teaches us the value of keeping a sense of presence; but using a record of photographs to observe progress towards a goal I see as a useful tool on the path.

<hr />

At times I've struggled to do a home practice because of the thought of having to take a picture to put on Instagram. There can be a feeling of pressure to rise to the amazing strength of the people one follows. However, with a little self contentment and a drive to be the best you can be, joining an online community and trying to keep up can be a good step towards happiness.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>On Dropping Everything for Yoga</title>
		<link>http://yogaseriousnotserious.com/2017/02/24/on-dropping-everything-for-yoga/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Drop Everything.</h3>
Last week I was having a conversation with a wonderful future teacher currently in teacher training, she said (with laughter) that it seems yoga is all that she does now! That it felt like there was no down time for anything else.

I remember during my own teacher training there were periods of time where there was seemingly nothing else than yoga practice and yoga study (and that was even with a day-job to worry about). For those two years there is an expectation to live and breathe yoga. The majority of people probably carry on this all encompassing yoga life past their teacher training, but I think there are differing outlooks, which I hope to write about. Let's call it variable approaches to yogic lifestyle.
<h3>The Variable Yogi - Physical Practice.</h3>
There have been periods of time where I've made myself feel guilty about not practicing for a few days in a row. The guilt can build up pretty quickly. But there's an internal switch I believe we all have about that sort of guilt, and as soon as you flick that switch from 'guilty' to 'just be chill about it', then instead of getting on the mat to prevent that guilt it instead becomes asana practice for the right reasons.

The message is don't beat yourself up about missing a day, or even doing 15 minutes and deciding it's not working for you today. Give yourself 15 minutes physical practice and spend some time just sitting for a while. Sitting is fine. <u>FINE</u>.

If you want to do two hours physical practice every day, that's fine too. Don't hurt yourself though, and I'm not joining you.

<hr />

<h3>Don't Drop Everything.</h3>
Yoga doesn't have a requirement to make enormous changes to the rest of your lifestyle. Being a vegetarian/vegan, giving up smoking, giving up drinking, or any number of other positive changes can be achieved using pursuit of a yogic lifestyle as an excuse. Obviously it's worth doing these things, I'm never going to say not to follow those pursuits, but it's worth remembering that there's no <b>requirement!</b>

Having said that, diving head first into the deep end and getting rid of what you don't need all in one go, it can work (from personal experience), so if yoga is the shakeup you need today, go for it.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>On New Years Resolution and Tapas</title>
		<link>http://yogaseriousnotserious.com/2016/01/01/on-new-years-resolution-and-tapas/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many of us are bound to set a New Years resolution at some point, and no doubt some of those will be to adopt a daily Yoga practice. In observing this societal tradition myself I considered how this commitment to daily practice fits with the Niyama-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapas_(Sanskrit)">Tapas</a>.

Tapas is often translated to something along the lines of self-discipline. In Patanjali's Yoga sutras we see Tapas broken into three main categories. Austerity, study, and the dedication of ones efforts to Yoga.

Austerity deserves a special mention, for the word 'austerity' is accompanied by negative emotion. The austere suffer no luxuries, and work by strict policy. By taking austerity in this manner, the practitioner might be forgiven for feeling a dedicated daily practice as a burden rather than a joy or positive step. Something that I believe should be included in more Yoga literature is we practice this because it's fun! Because it feels good! Yoga teachers are missing a trick by saying 'this really works your core', it's covering up what's really important, the enjoyment. Excuse yourself a moment of hedonism.

Study and dedication remain. By setting a New Year's resolution such as ensuring we practice Yoga every day, we are taking steps towards this self discipline and study. Only through practice can improvements be made, this sentiment is found throughout many texts. The Hatha Yoga Pradipika prescribes 'The practitioner will succeed, the non practitioner will not' - Chapter 1, Verse 64. The Bhagavad Gita says 'But by constant practice and by freedom from passions the mind in truth can be trained' - Chapter 6, Verse 35, in this case meaning that despite the complexities of the mind, the thought waves can be stilled through Yoga and conscientious effort on the path.

It is of course not only in Yoga we find practice as the solution to progress, but it's worth remembering that everyone who has come before you on the path of Yoga has only found development from within themselves, within their own efforts.

		<title>Proof in Positivity</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, the yoga class I regularly attend had a newcomer. Without knowing it she proved something to me about where positivity comes from and how to keep hold of it.

This girl had clearly been dragged there by her very keen and skinny friend. This class is one with an 'advanced' label but our practice varies a lot. So this newcomer was a bit overweight. Nevertheless, she was putting at least as much effort in as anyone else. However about halfway through, after working with plank a bit, something emotional was triggered and there were a few tears from the newcomer, due to feeling perhaps a bit incapable. Our teacher without a moments thought came over with some amazing words of reassurance and the situation was sorted. Smiles all round.

For the rest of the class I was thinking about the whole exchange. It won't be long before I'm a qualified teacher, how would I have handled this?! (The answer to this I still don't know)...

But here's the point. During our final half of the class and all through relaxation, I was thinking about all the things I might have said to a girl in a similar situation in my class. Positive cliches perhaps, 'Yoga is for every body!', 'Who you are today isn't who you'll be tomorrow!', or maybe a more calming philosophical cliche 'We are each on our own path'....

The worry of how I would handle such a situation continued, and in my head was a cycle of thinking how I might word this positivity to one of my own students. Repeatedly thinking these positive thoughts. Positive thoughts...over and over again.

But despite these thoughts being derived from worry, it wasn't long before I was feeling a sense of elation! One that I couldn't remember having for months if not years. I left that class beaming all the way home. From <em>trying</em> to think with an open heart, trying to push this positivity on somebody else, it worked inwardly.

I felt quite guilty afterwards. Perhaps I <em>should</em> have said some of those things to my yoga neighbour for the evening!

<hr />

Patanjali talks of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samskara_(Indian_philosophy)">Samskara</a>, the thoughtwaves of the mind. The continued thoughts we have can eventually define who we are through our character. Through this repetition of outward positivity I began forging my own Samskara. It's all about the continuation of this practice. Even in recalling the story to write about I'm beginning to feel that experience all over again.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>On Competition in Yoga Class</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Competition in yoga is a difficult one for me, something I've found a challenge from day one. Often there's not a single other male in my regular class, and I know it sounds so Neanderthal and not at all 21st century but it completely changes my practice when one does show up. I begin striving to push harder and hold longer than my opponents. I write these posts to remind myself of where I can improve as much as anything.

If we think about competition, a yoga competition would indicate there's some 'best' yoga which can be achieved. It suggests there's a finish line. But we're not working towards that perfect ten in yoga, there is no perfection. Every yogi will find themselves in a different place to where they were yesterday, perhaps finding a more heightened sense of balance or a lessensed sense of strength in their practice. However this change of 'ability' is not what defines where the yogi is, it's that awareness of the body, the connection they make between the physical presence and the mind. And as we do find a stronger practice, the day to day change will become more subtle, and it is the subtle awareness of these changes which should improve over time.

The first four of Patanjali's limbs of yoga describe behavioural and physical practices. The remaining four are concerned entirely with working with the mind to bring awareness internally, and describe the increasing levels of concentration within the mind. Practicing <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dh%C4%81ra%E1%B9%87%C4%81">dhārana</a> requires introspective focus and practicing <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratyahara">pratyahara</a> requires releasing awareness of those external presences (by ‘external presences' I'm almost certain Patanjali was talking about the other sweaty yoga dudes).

And so once we've moved our concentration inwards and once we've learned that the others don't matter. Once we're only concerned about our own bodies and we're building more and more towards the inward concentration, we're told to release competition even within our own selves! And surely the biggest competition we have here is mirrors. How anyone can look inwardly whilst attending a yoga class with a wall of mirrors is beyond me.

But anyway, fuck those other guys. You know the ones, the really strong and bendy ones. Fuck those other guys. I'll out hold them, probably.

I'd love to hear from the female perspective, and what competition exists there.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[What a brilliant observation. In my yoga class there are on average 4 male participants and the competitive nature at times is apparent. However, as a female  yogi newbe I have to watch the others to keep up with the class as I don't know all the moves. The indirect result of this is that I do find myself comparing what I am able to do with the others. Do I compete? Not really. But, it does make work harder and inspire me as to what can be achieved. And, perhaps more importantly it it making me work out how to fit in a practice slot between classes. I wonder if men with their competitive spirit are also inspired to practice?]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Feelings on being a yoga teacher. A little more personal. A constantly changing topic, and a list which is constantly being added to. This is the first in a series of "diary" like posts on the subject. I'll try to keep some themes/stats running as a constant.

<hr />

Dear Diary,
Classes taught since I've qualified: 63

Individuals taught: No idea really, probably a couple of hundred at least

Most difficult thing since starting teaching: Teaching yoga is definitely not without it's challenges. The business side of things is a big learning point for me. It's not something covered in teacher training! Every aspect of running a business is new so that's what I'm trying to develop at the moment. Money and tax, creating a consistent image, networking and building relations with other individuals and businesses!

Most enjoyable thing since starting teaching: Meeting the most wonderful people! I never know who's going to walk through the door. Historically I've struggled with chatting to random strangers (especially groups!), so this was a serious jump into the deep end, I'm grateful for the people who told me I could do it, I'll never forget the support.

<hr />

With any endeavour there is a rapid growth period at the start and then it tends to start becoming a bit more of a refining process. This goes for yoga practice, yoga teaching, and just about any skill I've ever learned. Getting to a point where I could competently teach a yoga class took years of developing my own practice and then years of deepening that knowledge until I was capable of presenting what I knew to others. Now that I have that basic level it's becoming more about the subtleties. For example, how do I make a newcomer feel welcome in a group of people who <i>seem</i> much more experienced? It's different depending on any individual, but if you ever find yourself in this situation as a newcomer then take it from me that everyone else in the class is probably making it up as they go along, doing their best to come across as knowing what they're doing! (The teacher certainly will be). Anyway, that's one thing I'm learning.

It's was a lightning fast two years of yoga teacher training. I'm sure over the two years I ended with more questions than answers, but it's that constant curiosity which keeps us alive and growing. Theres always more to learn, it's not like I've finished. You don't finish yoga.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Why I Started Yoga</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the question that get’s asked in the five minutes before class.

‘Why did you start yoga, then?’

I had forgotten how to sit on the floor. That’s my answer. There’s no telling when such a thing might have happened. No doubt it’s over a long period of time one loses such a skill.

I remember sitting on the floor when I was much younger, reading books on the floor of my childhood bedroom for an entire weekend. I must have spent hours playing with Lego sitting on the floor and I never remember it being too much effort. Sometimes I’d lie on my back with my legs above me on the mattress of the bed. Sitting on the floor was a lot more comfortable when I was that age than when I was in my first yoga class. I couldn’t sit cross legged without getting uncomfortable after five minutes. Sitting in Dandasana was such an effort, I felt for many weeks that I was going to fall over backwards. Remaining upright was as much as work as doing sit-ups.

I went to my first yoga class without thinking about the logistics of such an event. Of course they sit on the floor, but some naivety perhaps prevented me thinking that <em>I</em> would be sitting on the floor. I didn’t know what to expect so I chose not to expect anything, but we were indeed sat on the floor.

<hr />

There is a sense of child-like wonder I get when I sit on the floor. It is a Proustian moment of mine. Being thrown back to a time where life was so simple that I could spend the never ending weekend doing absolutely whatever I liked. There were no lists of things I needed to do just to keep myself in society, no bills to pay, no assumed expectation that I needed to be out and about meeting people. I remember a much greater sense of ‘Where I am right now is exactly where I need to be and there’s no problem with that’.

I remember some of the projects I would embark on during a long Summer holiday. Complexity didn’t seem to be any obstacle. No building project, or drawing, or collaboration, would seem insurmountable.

Invariably Summer would end, school would restart and all of a sudden I’d find myself without the time to idle around working on these projects, some of them completed, some of them not, it didn’t matter. But something new would always come up the next weekend or the next holiday.

<hr />

Yoga helped restore in me the wonder I had when I was care-free and without quite as many expectations of myself.

I have been reminded that there was a time when, during a project, even though I hadn’t finished <em>quite</em> yet, that it was okay to be in that state of not <em>quite</em> finished.

I’m a strong promoter of having personal goals, but sometimes it’s best that goal is just to sit on the floor. Maybe sit for just a while, maybe sit for a whole Summer.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>It&#039;s Probably Okay, To Say No More Often</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Invite.</h3>
Hyper-connected, we receive invitations, sometimes in advance but often ad-hoc. Drinks tonight, dinner tomorrow. Come to that yoga class with me later, and we’ll do ParkRun 9AM tomorrow morning.

Isn’t it tiring? Not the events themselves, no*, but the frequency and immediacy of it all. It can be minutes between seeing the event, and being expected to attend.
<h3>Winter.</h3>
<h4>We are just over the peak, and it’s cold.</h4>
Especially during Winter we’re programmed to rest and switch off, even just a little, and go to bed earlier, curl up, and eat more! Out of all the generations of humanity, we are the first one's who are spending artificial day's under artificial lights. Night has arrived outside and we're in the office, working. We get home and the TV is blinding us with cold light late into the evening, our body’s are replying with poor sleep and irritability. Just before bed we stare at our phones and check what's happened that we may have missed out on that evening.

Over the weeks of Christmas just past there were as many reminders, invites, and outings as always. The difference this time was that internal switch, thrown to tell me I didn’t need to say yes to every single gathering. If time for rest is not taken during those weeks, then surely we’ll never find time to rest for the remainder of the year?

And there is a stigma around saying no. After the meal when they say ‘We’re going for drinks next door’, who would make the excuse? ‘Actually, I’m probably going to go home and have a bath instead’. There can be a break in that mindset of everyone doing everything. When the majority live in cities there is no reason we can’t join and leave more freely. Even those on the outskirts are a short car journey away from the action.
<h3>Ahimsa.</h3>
<h4>Non Violence.</h4>
As much as not pursuing fights with others, we’re expected not to pursue fights with ourselves. It’s listening to one’s body and responding with care. Patanjali makes no exception for killing even when it is one’s duty on the battlefield. Patanjali, no doubt, would make no exception for telling ourselves that we must drag our body through another round at the bar when we’re being told by ourselves that it’s quite enough.

I see room for change in the expectations of society, that we can look after ourselves again, and not miss out on this gentle slow-down over the Winter.
<h3>Missing Out.</h3>
<h4>Yoga.</h4>
There <em>is</em> more to it, of course there is. Sometimes the anxiety of missing out on something can tear through the mind before we’ve had a chance to ask, ‘Am I thinking, with reason?’. That's where yoga comes in, switching to our thoughts. The mind needs to practice this to become strong, no differently from practicing the muscles of the body to become stronger.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

* Obviously yoga classes are never tiring, but always delightfully lovely and wonderful.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week I wrote about looking after oneself, especially during the winter months. You can read that post <a href="http://www.yogaseriousnotserious.com/2017/01/20/its-probably-okay-to-say-no-more-often/">here</a>.
<h3>Say Yes.</h3>
Yoga practice requires saying yes. All the time. For some of us just making it to a class is an achievement in itself. A home practice is hard to find when the rest of life is shouting at you from all angles. Making that decision to turn yourself to an activity which is by it’s nature very closed and independent can be seen as selfish by others, making that decision is often a big one.
<h3>Yes to the Universe.</h3>
Savasana, relaxation, is saying yes to the universe. Lying on our back with our eyes closed, exposing our whole body to whatever might be past our eyelids. Even turning our palms towards the sky so we haven’t got the comforting ground to cling on to. Saying yes to savasana runs a deep river through the mind that requires utter trust in the universe. Or certainly trust in everyone else in the room.

Working with inversions even for an experienced yogi can be a bold choice. From day to day our mind can change just subtly enough that it might seem quite a lot more scary than it did the previous time. Turning the world on it’s head, taking an action which exposes the mind to that different way of seeing, if only for a few seconds.

Yoga is the union of our tiny piece of the universe with the rest of the universe. It’s a place to give ourselves an opportunity to reconnect with the system which created us and the system which sustains us. The matter we are composed of is the exact same matter everyone else is composed of.

The effect on our mind of saying yes to relaxation, might not be that different to other events. Putting yourself out of your comfort zone by taking a deep savasana in a new environment is difficult but there’s that chance it can be fantastically rewarding. Is that not equivalent to saying yes to that wedding where you don’t really know anyone, giving yourself the opportunity to connect with other people, sharing existence? A contrived example perhaps, but yoga is not always performed on a mat.
<h3>We've Got You.</h3>
Those who say yes, and no matter what that thing may be. It might be the easiest option, and it might be the most terrifying. Whatever it is, I bow to you.

Those who sometimes struggle to say yes, sometimes you need to look after yourself in a different way and that’s fine by everyone. But when you are ready to say yes, me and everyone else...

We’ve got you.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here are the questions I’ve heard most often when talking to people about starting a yoga practice.
<h3>Do I need to be flexible?</h3>
The physical bit of your yoga class is about working out where your body is today, not where it’s been, and not where it’s going. I often remind my students to have a check in with their body before they start to move, does anything feel different to the last time you were in relaxation? Just a mental scan to see what <em>feels</em> like the present body.

Perhaps the misconception is seated in feeling like one might miss out on some part of the practice if they can’t do it already, but yoga is not something to learn overnight. Touching your toes every day isn’t doing yoga, and doing yoga isn’t touching your toes every day.

<strong>Short answer:</strong> No.
<h3>What do I need to bring with me?</h3>
"Clothes you can move about in", is the practical answer I usually give. You don’t need to bring the latest fashionable leggings, thats for certain, although we’re all guilty of getting caught up on that bandwagon.

Sticky yoga mats are a modern invention. Having a surface which will keep hands and feet in place will really build confidence, especially in a pose like Adho Mukha Svanasana. There we’ve got a lot of force going into the mat at the hands, and it’s nice to stick. You can push into the hands and get that wonderful release in the back. But as your practice builds, there’s a good chance you’ll feel a lot less reliance on the mat to keep you in place. The strength of the hip flexors taking the weight back over the heels, the strength in the lower abs sucking everything in to keep the shape of the body tall, and your hands wouldn’t slide away from your feet no matter what the surface is.
Original yoga texts talk of layers of dry grass, banana leaves, and finally an animal skin as a place to practice. Somewhat impractical for the modern class, but the point is it doesn’t really matter*.

What you <em><strong>should</strong></em> bring, is an openness of heart and mind to experience about 90 minutes of movement, breathing, relaxation, and meditation. Yoga, over time, can bring profound changes to the body and mind. When I attended my first class I was expecting to sit on the floor, of course, but having got home and eager to try some of these practices in my own time, it reminded me of a state of mind I’d lost somewhere since childhood, sitting on the floor and being just ‘me’. Over time hopefully your mind too will start to connect back to that feeling of just being you and your body. A you which is a little bit less worried about those niggling anxieties, a little more comfortable in your own skin, and a little bit happier sitting on the floor (or standing on your head, if you’re into that kinda thing).

<strong>Short answer:</strong> Your mind.
<h3>Is it religious?</h3>
Yoga is a religious practice so closely connected to Hinduism that I consider them the same thing. In a Hatha Yoga practice it is common to say “Namaste”, “Om Shanti”, and maybe even some chanting at the end. The words are so subjective to translation from Hindi. OM can mean anything from <em>nature</em>, <em>existence</em>, <em>everything</em>, or just <em>God</em>. The very sound of the word is sometimes interpreted as the sound that is so pure and natural that if you listened carefully enough every single thing in the universe would be making that sound. Whichever you want to take it as, it’s the practice around the word which is the useful bit. If Om to you means the connecting bits between you and your fellow yogi, awesome. If you use it as the seed sound of the universe to focus your meditations on for the rest of your physical existence, awesome.

<strong>Short answer:</strong> Only if you want it to be.
<h3>Is yoga good for losing weight?</h3>
Moving around more is going to burn calories. You’ll be doing that at most yoga classes. More importantly what you’ll also be doing is starting to gain a better understanding of your body.

Additionally, with time and practice, there might be a change in your relationship with food. Being mindful about what you eat comes hand in hand with being mindful about how your body moves, what your body needs some days, and what it doesn’t need other days.

Ultimately, any increase in physical movement will aid weight loss. However, attending a class (of anything) once a week, without a change in food habits, is probably not enough to notice any profound weight loss benefits.

<strong>Short answer:</strong> Yes. <span style="font-size: small;">(but there are no magic wands :) )</span>

*Don’t buy those unbelievably cheap generic ‘fitness mat’s, the kind with the inch thick foam which stretches when you put any force into it. You’ll end up throwing it away after a couple of weeks.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you winced, or rolled your eyes, having seen the title, this is for you. I’m certain someone will have! If you struggle with the idea of going to a yoga class and being forced against your will to chant foreign words along with the rest of the class, this is for you.

When human’s make a simple sound together, it harks back to a time of primal existence. Every culture that’s ever existed has understood their own form of making sound together, as a group. What could be more elemental than communicating hopes, fears, and advice through a common language? Over time that elemental sound has developed to more complex words and sentence, and the groups have found more formal structure, the verse and language itself adhering more to sets of grammatical rules. The chant’s I’ve enjoyed the most have been the simplistic, single syllables, made together in the group.

The meaning of the chant might be known by the teacher, they might explain the background, but to me the action itself is just as important as the message, if not more so. When we contribute to this common sound, one can be washed with a powerful sense of belonging to the group. That is what communication through language is all about, the connection of minds that would otherwise be distinct minds. Take those minds and unite them through common understanding of raw and simple sound. Chant phonetically, removing understanding of the words and enjoy that moment of being supported by fellow yogi’s, being carried through the moment on communal sound. When immersed fully, it can feel like the whole body reverberates on a separate plane of that sound. It might be hard to know for sure whether you’re still contributing at all.

It’s the sounds that matter perhaps more than the actual words, and the feeling of belonging is not that dissimilar from singing a drinking song in the pub, or joining a local choir*. So how about this, next time you’re at a yoga class and about to chant, forget the words and just feel the sound.

*Or even a boy band. Imagine yourself singing in a boy/girl band about how you’re hoping the boy/girl next door might hold your hand on the way to school. It’s probably not that dissimilar from phonetic chanting.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here are some phrases I've witnessed from yoga teachers over the years! I'm just as guilty as the next teacher on some of these. Have you ever heard anything like these in class?

<hr />

<h2>'Just one more round of Surya Namaskar'</h2>
You said that on the last round!

Standing at the front edge of the mat, exhausted from the one more round you just completed. You can feel the beads of sweat starting to make their way down your forehead.You're certain that if you moved your feet a little bit on the mat, it would squelch. The backs of your legs feel like the first time you had a go with a foam roller. As he walks around the room, beaming at his own sense of power, with the smirk, a clue about his self administered comedic awards. 'just one more'. sickening.  You look across the room at your dishevelled peers, and deep down in their eyes might have been the embodiment of hatred, if only it wasn't clouded by their sense of helplessness, life is now Sun Salutations. There is nothing more.

Yoga is hard sometimes :P
<h2>'Who'd like a spray of 'Lavender and Maccachuckawu aromatherapy oil' during Savasana?'</h2>
"That's okay thanks. My yoga top, despite being washed three times since, still smells vaguely of last weeks 'Kumquat and Cranberry Sauce'"
<h2>'Just do what your body feels!'</h2>
I could probably do that at home.

Like the waiter who asks how your meal is just as you've taken a mouthful. Just as you've summoned all your might to get up into what may be your best ever Urdvah Dhanurasana, as you finally release the head back into your shoulders, the teacher suggests it's now time to move on. Usually at this point in the class it's the person next to you who is usually doing something brave, today she's just having a little lie down. You open your eyes a moment, upside down,  everyone in the room is waiting patiently for you to stop fooling around in Wheel so they can carry on with what's next.
<h2>'Next week I leave for my annual 12 week holiday in India, see you in the Winter!'</h2>
Have fun teacher, I'll be sure to keep up the practice in the kitchen of my mid terrace flat while you're there.

<hr />

Okay, okay, broad stereotypes I know! I love you all &lt;3

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Brahman and the Atman</h3>
One of the fundamental teachings of yoga is the Atman and the Brahman. The Brahman is the whole manifestation of the universe and everything it contains. We are part of that system, and the part of the Brahman we have within ourselves is called the Atman. Yoga is the union of our Atman to the whole Brahman.

There is no difference between my composition as well as it's belonging to the whole, and your composition, and your belonging to the whole. This goes for me and you and every being.

The modern explanation of such an idea is no different. The raw materials we are each made from are no different to the raw materials our neighbour is made from. It is easy for us to think of the edge of our skin as the edge of our 'self', and anything beyond that is foreign. But look at it at a molecular level and there is no boundary. The matter inside and the matter outside is just the same. The edges of our selves are a lot more blurred than imaginable. Where we end and where the air begins is not a clear cut line.

(If you were really looking closely, my understand is the electron parts of some of those atoms due to their quantum nature would even be shared at the same time between you and everything around you. We're all in the same big soup of physical matter.)
<h3>My (naive) History Lesson</h3>
Disclaimer: I'm no history buff, but here's my take on the past and present attitudes towards arbitrary lines. Us humans historically, have had an alarming tendency towards segregation.
<ul>
 	<li>America has relatively recently had slavery as a conventional practice. It was only 1964 when the United States made segregation illegal.</li>
 	<li>In India, class division has been prevalent for centuries with the caste system. And as I understand it this still persists, promoting the same divides today, at least in some parts of the country.</li>
 	<li>In England it has always been a case of class division. The aristocracy versus 'the great unwashed'. The relics of this still exist in things like official titles and the House of Lords*.</li>
</ul>
No doubt there are plenty of examples in other countries.
<h3>Where are we today / a story of regression</h3>
The past 12 months have seen a number of events which put into question the understanding that we are all the same. Some events the other side of the world, and some events much closer to home. Some of these events have been have been a result of democratic process, and others have been independent acts. The common theme as I see it is a misguided opinion of what it means to be human, or indeed what it means to exist in our universe.
<h3></h3>
<h4>Love and Peace in everything, Om Shanti</h4>

		<title>A to Z of Yoga : A is for Ashtanga!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[First post of a new series! Here's the idea. We'll go through the alphabet picking a yoga related topic for each letter. I'll pick a few related words. Over time we'll build up a sort of yoga dictionary. Amazing. Let's start with A.
<h1>Ashtanga</h1>
Ashtanga is a style of yoga developed by yogi, fitness guru, and sadist K. Pattabhi Jois in 'the late 20th century' according to Wikipedia. The practice is centred around The Primary Series which is a predefined set of poses held for a set amount of breaths each.
<h4>Vinyasa</h4>
Vinyasas are a sort of practical joke which got out of hand, possibly as a result of a bad translation. In between almost every pose in an Ashtanga class is a vinyasa flow which includes a push-up, a backbend, and downward facing dog....in between every pose for 90 minutes. Hahaha I know right!?
<h4>Kino Macregor</h4>
Kino is a practitioner of Ashtanga Yoga, but she's also very attractive which has therefore brought her increased fame. Wearing not many clothes also contributes to her success, and at the last count she has over 1 billion followers on Instagram, some of whom are interested in yoga.
<h4>Mysore</h4>
Mysore is a popular style of Ashtanga class and is named after the Indian city. A Mysore class isn't led by a teacher, rather the attendees practice at their own pace and are expected to know how to get through the primary series already. The teacher in a Mysore class is more of a facilitator employed to unlock the door to let people in. Having said that, Mysore teachers do occasionally employ guilt-based techniques to make sure you are doing all the required vinyasas.

<hr />

There we are! Your intro to Ashtanga yoga :)

(I do honestly love it....occasionally)]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, it fits the rest of the image, doesn't it?

I've been vegetarian since August 2014. Not very long relatively, but long enough to have made my mind up about whether or not I'm sticking to it. The following is what I make of it all.
<h3>A bit technical, to start</h3>
Humanity is at a point where we know exactly what the body needs and doesn't need. There are recommended intake figures for everything, for example, B12 measured in the micrograms (2.4 as it happens, that is, 2.4 <em>millionths</em> of a gram). These values are so small that it's only very recently that we've been able to measure such things. B12 was only discovered in 1934, so your parents, or perhaps their parents would only just have known about it, had they been in circles which talked about such things.

So we know what the body needs. But the other half of the knowledge we require is not just what quantities are needed, but we also need to know what quantities are provided. And we do, we know what is provided by all of our food. The average large egg has 0.44 micrograms of B12. Easy peasy, do the maths, you won't miss anything your body needs to be super duper. There is available a satisfactory alternative means of nutrition.
<h3>But meat is delicious, right?</h3>
Well, I'm not so sure about that. Not <em>inherently </em>delicious. Looking at social history it's not that long ago that eating all sorts of offal was common. Tripe and onions anyone? Food follows fashion as much as anything else follows the fashion. Todays fashion is white chicken breast doused in peri-peri. In a couple of generations time won't it be remembered as the most bland cut of meat disguised as something exotic?

Understanding of our chemical composure and requirements has developed, the other thing which is forever <del>developing</del> changing is human morality. What was acceptable before, is not acceptable now, and of course the opposite is also true. Are we not at a point in human existence where there is no requirement for captivation of animals for food? Traditional Inuit diet is almost completely meat, eggs, and fish. In an arctic locale where agriculture isn't possible, I'd be eating as much whale blubber as the next guy. But when we're in a society where agriculture is possible in every corner of the country is there a reason to raise animals for food?

We've got the knowledge, and we've got the method.
<h3>Pizza</h3>
There is obviously the added question of dairy. I am not a vegan. I think done well, egg farming is fine. If resource allowed I'd definitely have a couple of laying hens clucking around in the back garden but for now I buy eggs I trust. Milk; not so keen on having a dairy cow roaming the garden, but I put enough trust in farmers to do a good job of that for me.
<h3>Eating mindfully</h3>
Whether you eat meat or not doesn't matter to me especially, I believe it more important to consider the impact you're having on the whole system. As individuals it's easier to believe we have only little impact, but collectively these impacts are amplified. Eating lamb that has been reared down the road is one thing, but eating New Zealand lamb is bonkers. Would you rather be eating high welfare meat and spending more money on it but only occasionally, or would you rather mass produced....'meat'.....every night?

In Christian culture saying a prayer before eating is the tradition. I'm not aware of any such equivalent in yogic tradition, but occasionally coming back to show gratitude for meals can have positive effects on how we eat. If you're taking the time to be considerate over food, then chances are you'll be eating better food, and also eating in better moderation.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Sage, Patanjali, talks of thought-waves or <em>vritti</em> as one of the fundamental parts of our Hatha Yoga practice. Every time we let a thought through the mind, it sets a wave which passes unhindered through our psyche. But the wake of the wave not only continues long after the initial wavefront passes, but builds up in the mind what is called Samskaras. The Samskara is the residual build up of numerous thought-waves over long periods of time. Ultimately these Samskara are what combine to form our character. Put more plainly, if you spend your days thinking negatively and pursuing negative actions, these will later manifest themselves as your character.

Yoga is the control of these thought-waves. Taking time into your day to work towards positive action, right mind, and right thought, is all yoga. Let the wake of each of these waves settle into your very being. It would be wrong to expect revolutionary changes of character overnight, but over longer periods of time we can work to undo what we have carried for so long, and find our inner-being once more.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Once Upon a Time</h3>
A decade ago in Birmingham, there was what I saw as quite a thriving rock subculture. No doubt there are those who were there a decade before that claiming to see the watering down of their own. Who doesn’t think that about their own existence, that theirs was the time to be a part of it?! But by the time I was ready to leave the city, ‘my’ part of the subculture had run it’s course. I think to investigate the same haunts now as I was then inhabiting then would be a sobering experience.

Those of us in the circle, we wore the same clothes, and we went to the same places. We ate the same food, and we listened to the same music*. We were labelled, and we were either marketed to, or marketed ‘at’. Even the rock club in Birmingham at the time was called ‘subculture’.

The telling thing to me now is just that, that we were marketed at. Looking back at those years I especially remember the griminess of it all, the people, the places. Only now do I start to wonder, or realise, that the marketing was suitably equivalent on purpose to match our assumed attitudes.
<h3>Yoga, the subculture</h3>
Think of a person who practices yoga. I’d guess you’ve gone for one of two images. A Western Female in their twenties or thirties with a yoga mat bag over their shoulder, probably in leggings. Less so but perhaps also likely, an Indian Male dressed in orange robes with a big beard. If the marketing is anything to go by then it is the former which you have jumped to, but that’s not to say I’m particularly enamoured with the latter as very yogic either.
No matter which variation, the subculture is still present. There is the clothing, music, lifestyle, location, and lastly, marketing campaigns.
<h3>Yoga, for?</h3>
From the Hatha Yoga Pradipika:

"Yoga is for the young, the old, the very old, the sick, or the weak"……"Success is achieved neither by wearing the right clothes, nor by talking about it. Practice alone brings success."

It does well to take these claims with a skeptical eye. This is, after all, the same book which makes some fairly off the wall statements about conquering death. But it does make a valid point about who can benefit from practicing yoga, and it’s not those who wear the right clothes and talk about the right things. It is everyone. Not just those that the marketeers will have you believe.

Come to class, no matter what your vibe.

<strong>If you’ve never been to class with me before and come along mentioning this blog post, then you can have that class for free!</strong>

* We also got our piercings done in the same place, but that didn’t fit in with the analogy as well ;)]]></content:encoded>

		<title>I Believe in Reincarnation (and so do you)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Same Page</h3>
Okay, okay. First we have to align our understanding of what reincarnation means. How about every time a creature (human or otherwise) dies, their soul, which they’ve developed over their lifetime, is suddenly free of it’s physical constraints and whisks itself over to another physical body which is not yet occupied by a soul? Thus that original union of body and soul is lost, but the soul part carries on in a new body to continue it’s development? Okay, okay, there’s the description of what our common belief in reincarnation is probably <em>not</em> going to look like. The transmigration of a soul to a newly born creature is pretty fantastical, and nothing if not romantic. Perhaps why such a belief persists is just that, the romanticism around it, the hope that nobody really dies, hope that life is eternal, and a strong opposition to accepting that this life is ‘it’.
<h3>The Proposition</h3>
An alternative I think we might unite on is this. The passing on of the soul between physical bodies. Okay, okay, that part is the same. But the difference being this process not occurring in an instant at the point of death/birth, but over the course of lifetimes.

We are born into this world which already has an established culture. Alongside the literal world which is at a certain level of understanding through scientific development, and the non-literal world which has it’s own theories developed over generations. These as distinct entities, and conjoined, have agreed on some things and disagreed on others. Religion has been trying to work these things out for millennia, and there is us, and billions of people around us trying to work it out for ourselves too.

And so at our birth the process starts. The physical body spends a long time, decades, absorbing from around it the culture, the spirit of the rest of the humanity, learning what it needs to build upon, and laying it’s own foundations for what our own self is going to start to believe.

We learn from our immediate family. To start with that learning is without criticism. Our parents <em>surely</em> do things the way everyone does. But as we reach out to other sources, perhaps school teachers and friends, ideas start to broaden, and perhaps we notice that rock which our blood relatives once was, isn’t quite as solid as it first appeared. There is a realisation of right and wrong, and that our parents, maybe just sometimes, might be on the wrong side of that line. It is a matrix of morality and choice we are navigating through, but with no absolute path.

The journey continues, developing our own ideas from what we witness in the world around us. Stories on the news, the good and the bad. The topics which our celebrities sing and dance about. Paintings and books and poetry and graffiti and tattoos and photos and fashion and architecture, all of this (and more) moulds us over time. There may be individuals in the limelight we feel particularly aligned to, their attitudes more reactive with us than others. This process never stops for as long as we are alive.

But then over time there is a gradual transition, we are always learning but there is a time where we have the foundations to start imparting that accumulation to the next lives. Everything we’ve established having seen where humanity is today and adding to it that tiny fragment of our own self.

It’s not always through a conscious act of ‘teaching’, but through our actions and our ideas, and through the way we portray ourselves. What we create to leave behind, and how we react to the creation of others. All these things contribute to those who listen. Firstly, to the people immediately around us, and secondly, to the society of tomorrow. The response of those immediate people around us gives quick feedback, but when there are many people contributing that same idea or act to society, there is more subtle feedback but bigger changes are made. And the new lives, they are desperate to learn, they are ready to absorb what the rest of humanity has to offer.
<h3>Different for everyone</h3>
But it’s not the same for all of us. Writers have an image of spending a lot of their lives accumulating, before being able to share back their own development. Whereas others of us have something to add far earlier in life, but perhaps it’s little and often rather than something more revolutionary all at once.
<h3>Reincarnation V2.0</h3>
Okay, okay. So the message is be nice and make nice things and contribute back to the system that raised you to be nice. The next generation will be nicer for it. It’s a twee sentiment, but I believe that’s reincarnation. And surely we can agree on that being a good thing?

The way in which you act outwardly is your chance at living forever. You might not be remembered as a hero of your day. But along with your neighbours and their neighbours, along with your football team, your colleagues, your bridge partner, and that girl on the telly you like, let’s be nice. And if we do it right, we might just about be able to avoid being remembered as the one’s who fucked it all up*.

<hr />

*That made for a nice sharp finish eh? But honestly, I think we’re doing alright. We’re getting better all the time, despite what the 24 hour rolling news coverage would have you believe. We’re doing alright.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Also Known As...'Your Mind'</h3>
It's a phenomenal force, isn't it? Every great work of art, every documented scientific process, and every shit TV series, are all works of someones mind (or collection of minds).
<h3>But What Else?</h3>
The effects of anxiety, stress, and depression can lead to poor physical health. The reverse is also true. By practicing techniques such as meditation to improve mood, physical health can improve or be maintained. The system of mind and body are connected and respond to each others ails. If one becomes ill then the other might follow, but making ourselves aware of frailties in both areas I think is the first step towards improving.
<h3>The Point</h3>
I'm a firm believer in you, and your ability to forge incredible benefits for you. Sometimes we need to learn processes and techniques to achieve it, but there are often times we are offered aids which claim to have the same power. So it's all coming down to this.
<h4 style="text-align: center;"><strong>If you have to <em>believe</em> in 𝒙, for 𝒙 to work, the power is all a result of the mind, not a result of 𝒙.</strong></h4>
&nbsp;

Your mind has the power to do all of those good things. But it doesn't need, <em>say, </em>common minerals sitting in a circle around you to do it. (In a lot of the crystal healing literature found I looked at, it appears Quartz is considered quite the panacea. It also represents 12% of the earth's crust. It's been used in pretty much every timekeeping device made since 1927, including computers and mobile phones. In short, it's everywhere. You can walk up hills and just pick it up.)

I wouldn't call it uncommon for <em>some</em> people in the yoga world to take this stuff a <em>bit </em>too seriously. If anyone tells me that I have to open my mind to something for it to work, that's where I lose interest in that thing.

<hr />

There <em><strong>are</strong></em> a number of practices in yoga which take a bit of a leap of faith to get benefit from. Chanting is something I wouldn't have had any buy into off my own back. But encouragement from the right people and a rational approach to what those benefits might be turned it into something tangible for me. You can read my convincer on chanting <a href="http://www.yogaseriousnotserious.com/2017/02/10/chanting/">here</a>! I think meditation would probably have been shunned by a lot of people not that many years ago. Luckily we're realising the benefits of meditation as a society more and more these days. (You don't need to buy anything for that either, not apps, not a special meditation cushion, not a singing bowl). This is representative of the separation between 'having a go at something and realising the benefits for yourself', and 'being told that something is only going to work if you put faith in it'. Not everything is going to work for everyone, chanting and meditation included, but it's worth a go!

Yoga is for everyone, and everyone's mind. You don't need to buy rocks to help. You can if you want to, but only if they look nice.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my notes for this post, I had the basic idea and how I was going to approach it. Get rid of the misconceptions around yoga such as the common 'group of middle aged women talking about the moon'* and give the first-timer an idea of what they might expect at their first class. But all my lines of thought into what a yoga class <em>is, </em>fell apart as I worked on them. The only theme I came to, was this.
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Yoga will fuck you.</strong></h3>
&nbsp;

If you are reading this as a potential first-timer, I might have to elaborate a bit.
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Hard.</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Okay okay! Enough of that. Sorry.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So there's two ways of looking at this. A good yoga class will develop and evolve, respond each week to the gradual change in attendees. Your first class might be one where that group is working hard on a physical practice. The good teacher (because it's a good class) will look after you and take you through what the rest of your classmates are doing, you'll work at your own pace, keeping up where you can but you might struggle with some of the stronger stuff. But under the expert guidance you'll leave the class somewhere between relaxed, stretched, but probably also feeling a little bit battered, and a little bit fucked. And that's fine, but that's not the sort of fucked I mean. Here's the second way of looking at it.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There will be a time, (it's unlikely that this will be the first class), perhaps a few months in, perhaps a few years in. You'll have the framework of your teacher's class pretty much in muscle memory and you'll get settled in like every other class. But there will be some mixture of events that don't quite fit together. The evolution of the class will be at a point where you and everyone else is going much more slowly than usual. Not abnormally slow, but just enough. And there might be a longer hold of one pose than you're used to. The plucky new student across the room might have done something you were sure took you hours of practice to get right. And all these things will manifest by creating this vacuum, a vacuum somewhere which is desperate to equalise. You'll start questioning what it's all about, unsure of whether you're in the right place. I mean, I've been convinced that I'm on the wrong plane of existence at some classes. That vacuum will appear when it appears, and once you've noticed it, it is then. That is when this series of minor differences will blindside you, that is when yoga will fuck you.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I've left class feeling like my whole world vision has just been pulled open and whisked. I've cried in class. I've stayed behind after class to confess to being a phoney and an impostor. But over time that vacuum does equalise. I think of it like a vacuum because it's the sudden removal of something which is no longer needed. Something which you were carrying, some anxiety, some core belief which you have pushed deep down inside to hide, and then all of a sudden you find what's needed to remove it and set it on it's way. And when that thing goes, it's hurts, but it goes, and it equalises.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;">In Summary</h3>
Your first class <em>is</em> going to be rolling around on the floor for a bit, pretending to be a tree for a bit, and <del>snoozing</del> performing relaxation. But stick with it, and there's a whole other world in there.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here we go.
<h1>Brahmacharya</h1>
Brahmacharya is one of the Yamas. Brahmacharya is roughly translated as the 'right use of energy'. An effort to conserve energy for the higher purpose of meditation. If you can't work out where this is going yet then I've spent a little while coming up with some modern alternative translations. Which one do you reckon is most succinct?
<ol>
 	<li>Don't put it about.</li>
 	<li>Stop being a slag.</li>
 	<li>No naughty business in the monks sleeping quarters.</li>
</ol>
Hopefully you get the idea. There is only one related word which needs explaining, here it is.
<h4>Yamas</h4>
These are the yoga equivalents of the ten commandments. Equivalently subjective. Equally outdated. And just as prone to 'slipping one's mind' when appropriate.

Have a great weekend all!

<hr />

PS. It took me a little while to decide between this and "Breathe". Not just the actual word breathe but the desperate instruction of yoga teachers. "Annnnnd Breaaaaatttttthhhhhheeeee". But we can come back to that at some point.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Southsea Fitness Festival</h3>
Tomorrow I'll be taking the stage at one of the Summer's regular events here in Portsmouth. This will be the third year running that the Southsea Fitness Festival has set up on Castle Field. It is a collection of all the local gyms, sports centres, and independent sport classes, promoting their services. With Portsmouth Yoga I head there each year to help out talking to people about yoga and getting involved with whatever activities are going on.

When I was looking down the list of other hosts, there was a mixture of the more common sports such as running, tennis, and swimming, alongside some of the more of the more alternative sports such as archery and dance. What these have in common is they are very firmly 'sports', compared to yoga which I've never seen as sport. However yoga is always involved in events such as this, but should it be?

<hr />

<h3>Just Physical Fitness?</h3>
Whilst it's true that yoga is going to get you fit if you do enough of it, you could say the same of any physical activity. Vacuuming the house is recognised as having positive health benefits, requiring a surprisingly high amount of energy for something usually done begrudgingly but also done often. But I wouldn't put vacuuming on the bill at a fitness festival.

If you were to go to your average high street chain of budget gym, they might have an offering of a 45 minute yoga class. Whilst this is going through what would be familiar poses it's a struggle to call it yoga as it would miss so much of the spiritual background and mental health benefit that a dedicated yoga studio would offer.

A lot of yogi's would argue that the only purpose of strengthening the body through the asanas is to enable staying in a meditation for longer and longer periods of time without the need to move or slouch. Letting the body get out of the way of the mind doing it's work. Not something I disagree with, but asana in itself is good fun, and not something I'd like to think of as just a tool for something else.

In my experience the benefits yoga gives to mental health is the foundation. Once that foundation has been made then the mind makes way for everything else. Time seems to go more steadily when the mind is at it's strongest and the troubles of fitness, eating well, good use of one's time, all these things work themselves out.

So to put an end to this ramble. Yoga gives that strength of mind, enough to start getting ready for anything else life is going to throw at you. Whether it's developing that strength for further meditation, letting your mind have a proper rest each day, or just managing the anxiety of getting on stage to teach yoga to a mass of skeptical fitness fanatics.

<hr />

Om Shanti

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Running</h3>
I run a lot at the moment. 5 or 6 days a week. It's a relatively recent pursuit of mine but I've really started getting into it. This September I'll be running my first marathon which is what all this training is in aid of.

At the moment I'm doing between 8-22km runs depending on the day, and a few hours after the run I'll often work with a physical asana practice to reset the legs and get me in shape ready for the next days running. The yoga compliments the running.
<h3>The Alternative View</h3>
The benefit of yoga to the runners legs is not the only part though. It's more than that one way relationship. I think long distance running has a lot to offer the yogi. Not least is the time with which one has to contemplate things. A lot of runners use headphones as an encouragement, something to energise them along. It is something I often do. However running is definitely nicer without headphones, without distraction running is a chance to take it all in. This is where I believe running starts to look a lot like meditation. Without the distraction of music and just one's surroundings, there is a lot of opportunity to really start tuning in to what's going on. It's that state where it's best to withdraw the mind from the physical details, and get straight into the mind, investigating what's there and beginning to take control.
<h3>Another Parallel</h3>
A common theme with long distance runners I'm aware of is the horrible ache of legs for the first 2 or 3 kilometres. It's a real struggle to tell yourself that your body is capable of running through that ache. It's not necessarily painful, but it's a blocker, and once it passes it passes and you wonder what the problem was now that you're gliding again like normal. (Maybe I'm just getting older sooner than I thought!). But this exactly mirrors my experiences with meditation. There's a period of sitting where I'm never sure whether I'm going to be comfortable at all. A period where it feels like all odds are against me getting into this meditation thing at all. But the common point is these initial aches and struggles pass, and what's beyond them is the good stuff. Once past the runners ache or the meditators 'pins and needles', it can be like being carried on a bed of awesome. Floating through the fields and over stiles, drifting into pure thought and developing a tighter grasp on consciousness. At this point to me the two are interchangeable.
<h3>Other Benefits</h3>
Bandha helps running. Breathing helps running. Mantra helps running.
<h3>The Exception</h3>
The exception is the heat.

The last week has been so hot that running has been a nightmare. Getting past the first 2km ache has gone quicker, but it's been replaced with sweat, and sweat, and hard breathing, and sweat. This is why yogis don't run. Because India is this hot all the time. This week I was out on a 16km run in 28Celsius, and I don't think I've ever wanted to just be at home in a bath full of ice until that day.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
So here it is, I'm confident the ancient yogi's would have been runners too, if India wasn't so hot.

<h3>You Can - A Message to the Doubters</h3>
Anyone can run. It's exactly what the human body was built for. A benefit of being upright on two legs is that when we run all our organs are contained in their column of ribcage. Animals that run on 4 legs have internal organs which move backwards and forwards through the ribs when they run. They have an advantage of bursts of speed being low to the ground and four limbs to get them going, but long distance running for four legs is exhausting and uncomfortable as the organs shift in the other plane. Human hunters would track animals across the fields and forests until the animal was just exhausted enough to give up and die. <strong>We are built for this. You are built for this.</strong>

(I don't have as much experience with long distance swimming or cycling but I'm sure the same principles would apply.)
